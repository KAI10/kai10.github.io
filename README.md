## Summary
I obtained my BSc. in Computer Science and Engineering [(CSE)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology [(BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/) with my major in AI.

I am interested in spatial databases and machine learning. I have also worked with meta-heuristics applied in transit network design problem.

## Research
* **A Heuristic Aided Stochastic Beam Search for Solving Transit Network Design Problem**  
**Kazi Ashik Islam**, Ibraheem Muhammad Moosa, Jaiaid Mobin, Muhammad Ali Nayeem and M. Sohel Rahman.  
Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, Elsevier (Under review)  
__Summary:__ Designing efficient routes for a transit network is one of the main problems faced by city planners of the world. Designing these routes is a multi-criteria decision making problem with a large solution space. In this paper we present a novel heuristic that can quickly generate good solutions. Also we propose a Stochastic Beam Search algorithm with a heuristic inspired successor operator. We conduct extensive experiments on some benchmark data-sets and perform statistical tests on the results. We compare our results with previous studies and show that our algorithms produce superior results. In particular, for large data-sets, the solutions generated by our heuristic in less than a second turn out to be better than solutions generated in two hours by the state of the art algorithm.
* **[Towards Efficient Maintenance of Continuous MaxRS Query for Trajectories](http://openproceedings.org/2017/conf/edbt/paper-207.pdf)**

__Summary:__ We address the problem of efficient maintenance of the answer to a new type of query: Continuous Maximizing RangeSum (Co-MaxRS) for moving objects trajectories. The traditional static/spatial MaxRS problem finds a location for placing the centroid of a given (axes-parallel) rectangle R so that the sum of the weights of the point-objects from a given set O inside the interior of R is maximized. However, moving objects continuously change their locations over time, so the MaxRS solution for a particular time instant need not be a solution at another time instant. In this paper, we devise the conditions under which a particular MaxRS solution may cease to be valid and a new optimal location for the query-rectangle R is needed. More specifically, we solve the problem of maintaining the trajectory of the centroid of R. In addition, we propose efficient pruning strategies (and corresponding data structures) to speed-up the process of maintaining the accuracy of the Co-MaxRS solution.

__Summary:__ We present a system for efficient detection, continuous maintenance and visualization of range-constrained optimal density clusters of moving objects trajectories, a.k.a. Continuous Maximizing Range Sum (Co-MaxRS) queries. Co-MaxRS is useful in any domain involving continuous detection of “most interesting” regions involving mobile entities (e.g., traffic monitoring, environmental tracking, etc.). Our system solves two important problems: (1) Efficiently computing Co-MaxRS answer-set; and (2) Visualizing the results.
