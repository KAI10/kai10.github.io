## Summary
I obtained my BSc. in Computer Science and Engineering [(CSE)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology [(BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/) with my major in AI.

I am interested in spatial databases and machine learning. I have also worked with meta-heuristics applied in transit network design problem.

## Projects
### Academic
* **Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition Projects:** I implemented these projects as part of CSE 472, 474 (Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition) courses. I used various tools such as: C/C++, Python, Matlab for implementation.
  * [Decision Tree Learning for Cancer Diagnosis](https://github.com/KAI10/Decision-Tree-Learning)
  * [Ensemble Learning (AdaBoost) for Cancer Diagnosis and testing results by cross validation](https://github.com/KAI10/Ensemble-Learning)
  * [Topic Modeling using Gibbs Sampler on 20 newsgroups dataset](https://github.com/KAI10/Topic-Modeling-Using-Gibbs-Sampler)
  * [Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model](https://github.com/KAI10/EM-Algorithm-for-Gaussian-Mixture-Model)
  * [Variants of Perceptron Algorithm](https://github.com/KAI10/Perceptron-Algorithms), [Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/KAI10/Artificial-Neural-Network)
  * [Template Matching to track a reference object in a video file](https://github.com/KAI10/Template-Matching)
  * [Channel Equalization using context dependent classification](https://github.com/KAI10/Channel-Equalization)
  * [Clustering (DBSCAN) Algorithm](https://github.com/KAI10/Clustering-Algorithm)
* **[Semi-Autonomous Obstacle Avoider](https://kai10.github.io/Semi-Autonomous-Obstacle-Avoider/)** In this project we designed afour wheel car which can automatically avoid obstacles in its way and maintain a definite direction. Itcan also be controlled manually. **Tools:** Raspberry Pi, Python.
* **[Simplified Automated Quad-copter](https://kai10.github.io/Simplified-Automated-Quad-copter/)** This project was done as a part of CSE 316 (Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Sessional) course. We controlled simple movements of a quad-copter by avr micro-controllers. **Tools:** AVR Microcontroller, C
* **[Online Card Game](https://kai10.github.io/Online-Card-Game-29/)** This is a java implementation of popular card game 29. Players on the same localnet can play. Multiple games at the same time is supported. **Tools:** Java.
* **[Grayscale Image Conversion](https://kai10.github.io/Grayscale-Image-Conversion/)** This is a C program that can convert a BMP (bitmap) image file to it's gray-scale version. It uses "iGraphics" library which is a wrapper for OpenGL in 2D.
* **[Tower of Hanoi Simulator](https://kai10.github.io/Tower-of-Hanoi-Simulator/)** It is a C program that simulates and solves the tower of hanoi problem. For GUI, it uses “iGraphics” library which is a wrapper for OpenGL in 2D.
